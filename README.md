# SocialMedia
The code supports animated gif slider social media posts that should be relatively easy to update for people without coding experience.

You can take this python code to create a LinkedIn image that slides between two images and gives followers the chance to say which they prefer. 

Use Case: I used it for a branding exercise comparing two logos to get feedback on which version is preferred.

Instructions:
1.This uses linkedin specs but you can update pixel size
2.Save your images in the same folder your code is in.
3.Put your file names into the function, establish a filename.
4.Update the file names and output file name where indicated in the script 
An animated gif is produced ready for posting.

Requirements for the slider file if you run this locally.  

Python: Version 3.6 or higher
Pillow (PIL): Version 10.2.0 or higher
NumPy: Version 1.26.4 or higher
